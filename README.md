# STM32F103x_Drivers
Welcome to the STM32F103x Drivers repository! This collection of drivers is designed to provide support for **cortex-M3** arm System-on-Chip (SOC) microcontrollers especially STM32F103C6, making it easier for embedded software engineers to work with different platforms.

## STM32F103C6 Specs
   - **ARM Cortex -M3 CPU Core**
      - 32-bit MCU
      - Maximum CPU speed of 72 MHz.
      
  - **Memories**
      - 64 Kbytes Flash memory
      - 20 Kbytes of SRAM
